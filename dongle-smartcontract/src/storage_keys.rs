//! Storage key types for persistent storage. Modular to allow future extensions.
//!
//! ## Key namespace design (closes #665)
//!
//! Soroban `#[contracttype]` enums are XDR-serialised as a tagged union of the
//! form `(variant_ordinal, payload)`.  The Soroban SDK caps a single union at
//! **50 variants** — attempting to compile a 51st case panics the macro.
//!
//! ### StorageKey (first 50 variants)
//!
//! `StorageKey` holds the original, core set of storage keys.  It currently
//! has exactly 50 variants (ordinals 0–49).  Adding more variants to this enum
//! would push it over the cap and break the build.
//!
//! ### ExtensionKey (overflow — independent namespace)
//!
//! When `StorageKey` reached 50 variants, all new keys were added to
//! `ExtensionKey`.  Because `ExtensionKey` is a *different* XDR union type,
//! its ordinals are **entirely independent** of `StorageKey`'s ordinals.
//! There is **no cross-enum collision**: `StorageKey::Project(0)` and
//! `ExtensionKey::ClaimRequest(0)` serialise to different byte sequences and
//! never share a ledger entry.
//!
//! The only soundness requirement is that the two names used in the *same*
//! enum must be unique — the Rust compiler enforces this.
//!
//! ### Capacity and the 50-variant limit
//!
//! `ExtensionKey` follows the same 50-variant cap.  Its current variant count
//! is tracked by `tests::storage_key_uniqueness`.  When `ExtensionKey`
//! approaches 45 variants (the warning threshold) a third enum
//! (`ExtensionKey2`) must be introduced following the same pattern.
//!
//! The warning threshold test (`extension_key_variant_count_below_warn_threshold`)
//! will fail loudly before the limit is reached.
//!
//! ### Performance
//!
//! Key lookup is O(1) — the key is XDR-serialised once per call and handed
//! directly to the host storage map.  The two-enum split adds zero runtime
//! overhead.
