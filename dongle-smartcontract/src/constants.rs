// ── Field length limits (string byte lengths) ──────────────────────────────
//
// Every user-supplied string field is bounded on write. The limits balance
// three constraints:
//
//   1. **Soroban ledger entry size.** A single persistent entry must stay well
//      under the ~64 KiB XDR limit; project entries aggregate ~15 fields plus
//      Vec indexes, so each field is kept to the smallest size that fits its
//      purpose.
//   2. **Validation cost.** Character-set checks copy the string into a
//      fixed-size stack buffer (`[u8; N]`) in `utils.rs`; the buffer is sized
//      from these constants, so smaller limits mean smaller stack frames and
//      cheaper CPU metering.
//   3. **Display/UX.** Names, categories and slugs appear in lists and URLs and
//      are deliberately short; descriptions are the one "long form" field.
//
// Rationale for each value is on the constant. See `docs/STORAGE_SCHEMA.md` for
// the integrator-facing table and `src/tests/field_limits.rs` for the
// boundary tests that enforce every limit at `N` (accepted) and `N + 1`
// (rejected).
