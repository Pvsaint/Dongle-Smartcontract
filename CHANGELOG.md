# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Dongle Smart Contract** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## How to read this file

- Every release has its own `## [MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, newest first.
- Changes are grouped under the Keep a Changelog categories: `Added`, `Changed`,
  `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.
- Entries marked **BREAKING** change an on-chain interface (function signature,
  storage key, event topic, or error code) and require operator action before or
  during upgrade. See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the upgrade procedure.
- Unreleased work lands under `## [Unreleased]` and is folded into the next
  version at release time.

## How to add an entry

Contributors must add a bullet to `## [Unreleased]` in the same pull request as
their change. Keep entries user-facing, one line each, and reference the issue or
PR number where available:

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **#740: Governance parameter ranges (framework).** New `governance_ranges`
  module stores each governance parameter's valid `[min, max]` range in contract
  config (`GovernanceKey`), exposes `GovernanceParam` / `ParamRange`, and reserves
  errors 96 (`ParameterOutOfRange`) and 97 (`InvalidParamRange`) so every
  parameter write can be validated with a clear message before it is applied.
- **#741: Verification SLA tracking (framework).** Default verification SLA is
  now **7 days** from request to decision (was 3 days), with `SlaKey` storage,
  `SlaRecord` / `SlaStatus` / `VerificationSlaMetrics` types, 24-hour breach-alert
  lead time (`SLA_ALERT_LEAD_SECONDS`) and a bounded alert scan
  (`MAX_SLA_SCAN_BATCH`) for per-admin / per-region overrides.
- **#742: Bulk project import (framework).** `MAX_BULK_IMPORT_PROJECTS = 1000`
  caps a single import transaction, with `ImportReport` / `ImportFailure` types
  for per-record validation results and errors 98/99
  (`BulkImportValidationFailed`, `BulkImportTooLarge`) for all-or-nothing rollback.
- **#747: Project ownership recovery for lost accounts (framework).** Recovery
  constants (10 endorsements to nominate, 7-day community vote, 75% approval,
  30-day owner reclaim window), `RecoveryKey` storage and
  `OwnershipRecoveryCase` / `RecoveryStatus` types with errors 100/101
  (`RecoveryCaseNotFound`, `RecoveryNotActive`).

- **#804: Review archival to cheaper storage with query access and automatic job.**
  Reviews older than 2 years (configurable via `REVIEW_ARCHIVE_AGE_SECONDS = 63_072_000`)
  can now be archived by an admin to a compact, shorter-TTL on-chain record, freeing
  primary persistent storage rent. New contract entrypoints:
  - `archive_old_reviews(admin, project_id, batch_size)` — admin-only; moves eligible
    reviews to `ArchivedReview` records at 30-day TTL (vs 60-day active TTL), removes
    them from primary storage and active indexes, emits `ReviewArchivedEvent` for each
    archived review so off-chain indexers can persist the full payload to permanent
    storage (Arweave/IPFS). Processes up to `MAX_ARCHIVE_BATCH_SIZE = 50` reviews per
    call; call repeatedly for large projects. Project stats
    (`rating_sum`, `review_count`, `average_rating`) are preserved.
  - `get_archived_review(project_id, reviewer)` — returns the compact `ArchivedReview`
    record (rating, content CID, timestamps, optional Arweave TX ID) for a specific
    archived review.
  - `list_archived_reviews(project_id, start_index, limit)` — paginated enumeration
    of all archived reviews for a project (uses `ProjectArchivedReviews` index).
  - `set_archived_review_arweave_tx(admin, project_id, reviewer, arweave_tx_id)` —
    admin-only; records the Arweave transaction ID after an off-chain job persists the
    review payload to permanent storage.
  New types: `ArchivedReview` (compact archive record in `types.rs`), `EvidenceLink`
  (URL + dead-link flag, also resolves a pre-existing missing type).
  New event: `ReviewArchivedEvent` (`REVIEW`/`ARCHIVED` topics) carrying the full
  review snapshot for off-chain consumers.
  New errors: `ReviewArchived = 85` (use `get_archived_review` instead),
  `ReviewNotArchived = 86` (for `set_archived_review_arweave_tx` guard).
  New storage keys: `ExtensionKey2::ArchivedReview(u64, Address)` and
  `ExtensionKey2::ProjectArchivedReviews(u64)`.
  New constants: `REVIEW_ARCHIVE_AGE_SECONDS`, `MAX_ARCHIVE_BATCH_SIZE`,
  `LEDGER_THRESHOLD_ARCHIVED_REVIEW`, `LEDGER_BUMP_ARCHIVED_REVIEW`.
  New script: `scripts/archive_old_reviews.sh` — cron-ready automated archival
  job that iterates all projects, archives in batches, handles retries, supports
  `--dry-run`, `--project-ids`, and `--start-id` flags, and emits instructions
  for recording Arweave TX IDs back to the contract.
  Tests in `tests::review_archive` (18 tests) cover: admin-only enforcement, 2-year
  threshold, mixed-age reviews, stats preservation, paginated listing, field accuracy,
  Arweave TX recording, batch capping, idempotency, and user-index cleanup.
- **#666: Batch TTL extension fail-fast and error reporting.** `extend_projects_ttl`
  and `extend_reviews_ttl` now return `BatchTtlResult` (new type in `types.rs`)
  instead of a bare `u32`. The struct carries `refreshed` (count of items
  extended) and `skipped_ids` (IDs not found in storage). Missing items are
  skipped with continue semantics; oversized batches are still rejected
  immediately with `InvalidInput`. Callers that need all-or-nothing semantics
  assert `result.skipped_ids.len() == 0`. Tests in `tests::ttl_batch` verify
  all-or-nothing detection, partial-failure reporting, empty batches, and
  oversized-batch rejection.
- **#665: Storage key collision detection and capacity guards.** New test module
  `tests::storage_key_uniqueness` verifies: `StorageKey` stays within the
  Soroban 50-variant cap; `ExtensionKey` stays within the cap; both enums emit
  a loud warning when they reach 45 variants (a new-variant-free capacity
  threshold); `StorageKey` and `ExtensionKey` produce distinct XDR for the same
  discriminant index (cross-enum isolation); same-name variants in different
  enums (`VerificationDuration`) never share a ledger entry. Module-level docs
  in `storage_keys.rs` document the overflow model, the 50-variant cap, and the
  `ExtensionKey` / future `ExtensionKey2` split strategy.
- **#664: Pause/unpause state machine documentation and recovery tests.** New
  test module `tests::pause_state_machine` adds: state-machine transition tests
  (RUNNING→PAUSED→RUNNING, idempotent pause/unpause); data-integrity tests
  verifying that projects, reviews, admin list, fee config, and follower lists
  are unchanged after pause/unpause cycles; a full-recovery test confirming all
  mutating operations resume after unpause. `emergency_pause.rs` module docs
  now include the state-machine diagram, allowed-operations table, and a
  step-by-step recovery checklist for the operations team.
- **#663: Follow/subscribe relationship clarity.** New test module
  `tests::follow_subscribe_relationship` verifies all six consistency invariants:
  `is_following` mirrors `ProjectFollowers` and `UserSubscriptions` atomically;
  `get_follower_count` equals `ProjectFollowers` length; duplicate follows return
  `AlreadyFollowing`; unfollowing without prior follow returns `NotFollowing`;
  following a non-existent project returns `ProjectNotFound`; pause guard applies
  to `follow_project` and `unfollow_project`. `subscription_registry.rs` docs
  now clearly state that "follow" and "subscribe" are synonymous — there is no
  separate subscribe operation.

### Changed

- **`extend_projects_ttl` / `extend_reviews_ttl` return type changed from `u32`
  to `BatchTtlResult`.** Callers that previously compared the return value to a
  count must now read `result.refreshed`. **BREAKING**: any off-chain client
  that pattern-matches on the `u32` return must update to the new struct shape.
  Confirms every `ProposalPayload` variant is gated by the same live
  quorum check in `execute_proposal`, documents the `SetThreshold` downgrade
  supermajority exception, the non-snapshotted-threshold consequences, and the
  `reject_proposal` single-admin veto model (#630).
- Tag validation now rejects duplicate values (case-insensitive after ASCII
  lowercase normalization) with `InvalidTags` (#526).
- **Governance: threshold-downgrade supermajority rule.** A
  `ProposalPayload::SetThreshold` proposal that would *lower* the current
  approval threshold now requires strictly more approvals than the proposed new
  threshold before it can execute. This prevents a colluding group of exactly
  `new_threshold` admins from using the proposal path to silently dismantle the
  multi-sig quorum. Raises new error `ThresholdDowngradeRequiresSupermajority`
  (code 74) when the guard is violated. Threshold *increases* and no-ops are
  unaffected and still require only the live threshold.
- **Integration test: full verification-fee payment lifecycle**
  (`src/tests/fee_lifecycle.rs`). Nine tests covering: pre-payment rejection,
  `pay_fee` sets flag and records details, token balances correct, flag cleared
  after `request_verification`, second request without re-payment rejected with
  `InsufficientFee`, re-payment restores the flag, payment-details audit record
  retained after consumption, treasury balance accounting.
- **Architecture documentation** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). A new contributor
  reference covering: four-layer ASCII module map, Mermaid dependency graph for
  all 20+ modules, two annotated Mermaid sequence diagrams (`request_verification`
  happy path and multi-sig proposal lifecycle), complete storage-key tables for
  `StorageKey` and `ExtensionKey`, event taxonomy table, and a full module
  reference. Linked from `README.md` Quick Links and Documentation sections.

### Changed

- **Timelock: enforced maximum scheduling delay.** Scheduled admin actions
  (`schedule_set_fee`, `schedule_add_admin`, `schedule_remove_admin`) now reject
  an `execution_timestamp` more than `TIMELOCK_MAX_DELAY` (90 days) in the
  future, in addition to the existing `TIMELOCK_MIN_DELAY` (1 day) lower bound.
  Zero-delay / past timestamps were already rejected. Both bounds are now
  documented in `constants.rs` and `docs/TIMELOCK.md` (#631).
- **Repository hygiene:** Consolidated repository-root documentation. Reference
  documentation now lives in `docs/` (`CONTRACT_INTERFACE.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DATA_EXPORT_GUIDE.md`, `ERROR_CODES.md`,
  `EVENTS_SCHEMA.md`, `STORAGE_INDEXES.md`, `THREAT_MODEL.md`), and transient
  internal status/summary notes were removed from the root. The repository root
  now contains only `README.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, and this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Updated stale documentation links in `README.md`, `docs/`,
  `dongle-smartcontract/README.md`, and `bug-bounty/README.md` to point at the
  consolidated `docs/` paths.
- Pinned the Rust toolchain (1.85.0) in CI workflows for reproducible builds
  (#514).
- Timelocked admin proposals now verify the proposal payload hash before
  execution.
- **Governance: `set_admin_approval_threshold` documentation clarified.** The
  function is intentionally blocked (returns `Unauthorized`) once the threshold
  exceeds 1. All threshold changes while multi-sig is active — including
  lowering — must go through `create_proposal` / `execute_proposal` and are
  subject to the supermajority rule described above.
- **Git hygiene: removed stale snapshot files from index.** Six Soroban test
  environment snapshots under `dongle-smartcontract/test_snapshots/` were
  tracked despite the `test_snapshots/` ignore rule in
  `dongle-smartcontract/.gitignore`. They were untracked via
  `git rm --cached` (the files remain on disk for any local snapshot test
  runner). The root `.gitignore` now also carries an explicit
  `dongle-smartcontract/test_snapshots/` entry so the rule is honoured
  regardless of which directory git is invoked from.

### Removed

- Committed test output text files (`test_output.txt`, `test_final.txt`,
  `test_output_latest.txt`) from the `dongle-smartcontract/` directory (#503).

### Fixed

- **Restored source dropped by the `5608c72` / `527565b` merges so the crate
  builds again.** Recommendation, community-collection, social-analytics,
  probation and bookmark-folder code (types, storage keys, events, error
  variants) was re-added from `f74e102` / `896d122`, three unclosed delimiters
  were closed, and re-added error variants were renumbered from 102 upward to
  avoid colliding with the appeals/assignment range. `ExtensionKey` exceeded
  Soroban's 50-variant `#[contracttype]` cap, so 9 keys moved to `ExtensionKey2`.
- **Test suite compiles again.** Fixed broken imports, stale entry-point names,
  missing `ProjectUpdateParams` fields, and `Option<unit-enum>` struct fields
  (`CommunityCollection::template_source`, which soroban-sdk 22 cannot encode
  under `testutils`) — 13 compile errors that made `cargo test` impossible.
- **Lenient CID validator accepts the documented 40-byte floor (#667)**
  (`MIN_CID_FLOOR`), while `is_valid_ipfs_cid_strict` keeps enforcing the
  canonical 46-byte CIDv0 minimum (#620).
- `ReviewRegistry::delete_review` / `admin_delete_review` now delete the review's
  evidence links instead of leaving them orphaned in persistent storage.

- **Governance: added the missing `MultiSigRequired` error variant** (code 77).
  `AdminManager::add_admin` / `remove_admin` returned
  `ContractError::MultiSigRequired` when the approval threshold is > 1, but the
  variant was never defined in `errors.rs` — a compile error contributing to
  the broken build. Surfaced by the approval-threshold consistency audit
  (`docs/APPROVAL_THRESHOLD_AUDIT.md`, #630).
- `AlreadyLinked` was returned for three unrelated conditions (duplicate link,
  duplicate maintainer, missing linked project), so clients could not tell them
  apart (#462).
- Documented previously undocumented verification events in
  `docs/EVENTS_SCHEMA.md` (#508).
- Applied `cargo fmt --all` across the workspace, clearing the pre-existing
  `rustfmt` drift in 18 source files that was failing the CI `Formatting` job
  and blocking the `Build Contract` and `Optimize WASM` jobs. Formatting only —
  no logic, signature, storage key, event or error code was changed.
- CI `Optimize WASM` job: install the Stellar CLI from its prebuilt release
  binary (pinned to 27.1.0) instead of `cargo install --locked stellar-cli
  --features opt`. The published crate now requires a rustc newer than the
  toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.85.0), so building it from
  source failed immediately; the prebuilt binary already bundles `wasm-opt`
  and installs in seconds.
- `scripts/optimize_wasm.sh` now selects an optimizer at runtime
  (`stellar contract optimize`, then `wasm-opt -Oz`), verifies the output file
  was produced, and exits with actionable install instructions when no
  optimizer is available.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-01

_Dispute flow, pagination and registry hygiene._

### Added

- Duplicate project dispute flow (#151).
- Possible-next-state coverage for the verification state machine.
- Project changelog CID feature, letting projects publish their own release
  notes off-chain (#157).

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Renamed offset pagination cursor parameters to `start_index`
  across all paginated views; callers passing the old parameter name must be
  updated (#351).
- **BREAKING:** Unified claim status handling across both claim workflows, so a
  single `ClaimStatus` enum is now returned by both paths (#357).
- Consolidated registry helpers into `remove_item_from_vec` and removed the
  unused `FeeRefundRecord` scaffolding.

### Fixed

- Repaired corruption in `utils.rs` and restored the missing
  `validate_report_reason_cid` function (#408).
- Timelock and endorsement operations now return `ContractError` values instead
  of raw panics.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-01

_Verification expiry, anti-Sybil controls and safety hardening._

### Added

- Verification expiry implementation (#131).
- Anti-Sybil review constraints: reviewer eligibility age, endorsement
  requirements and review fees.
- Emergency stop / contract pause with an admin pause toggle.
- `get_config` view for public configuration read access (#202).
- `MIN_STRING_LEN` validation constants.
- Admin console contract configuration view.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Replaced raw panics with `ContractError` variants and added 22
  new error codes (61-82); integrators must map the new codes. See
  [`docs/ERROR_CODES.md`](docs/ERROR_CODES.md).
- Collapsed roughly 20 near-identical `extend_*_ttl` storage helpers into a
  single generic helper (#338).
- Consolidated CID validators and their error handling.
- Extended `.gitignore` coverage for test output files and cleaned up the
  Makefile (#384).

### Security

- Emergency pause blocks state-mutating entry points while active, limiting
  blast radius during incident response.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

- Project endorsements.
- Bug bounty metadata and a `bounty_url` field on projects.
- Optional project license field.
- Verification evidence updates while a request is pending.
- Fee boundary validation, review tombstones, review sorting and a review
  update cooldown.
- Fee payment payer getter, reserved names, verification assignment and logo
  asset guidelines.
- WASM size optimization, invariant tests and property-based pagination tests.
- Weighted rating calculation.

### Changed

- Expanded Soroban deployment and schema documentation.
- Co-located example and schema JSON files in `docs/`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-01

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-01

_Extended feature set._

### Added

- Admin role management and access control system.
- Project verification system with automated fee handling and admin controls.
- Review timestamps plus review security and auditability improvements.
- Strict project name validation and normalization policy.
- Auth-matrix test coverage (#215).
- Region metadata, integrity hash, owner review block and event snapshot tests.
- Verified contract claims and sorting options.
- Project metadata CID schema and the admin rotation playbook.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-25

_Initial contract._

### Added

- Initial Rust / Soroban smart contract structure.
- Core Dongle modules: project, review, verification and fee management, with
  associated types, events and error handling.
